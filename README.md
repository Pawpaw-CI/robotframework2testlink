robotframework2testlink
=======================

Reporting Robotframework results to Testlink test manager

This is very initial version. Use it as a example but don't expect it
to be fully functional at this stage.

 * testlinkapi.py:   This is basic wrapper over TestLink PHP API

 * rf2testlink.py:   It's example of listener used once to publish
                     Robotframework test results into TestLink
